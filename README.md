## Dog Park

## Description

Dog park keeps you on your feet as you pick up your dog's little surprises before other dog park patrons or their pooches can encounter them.  

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at __________________ (YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL).


## Game Logic

```
XXX Remember to delete the instructions for this repo section below before finalizing and submitting your project because the this project is part of your portfolio you should be showcasing. XXX

Instructions: 
In this game, you are an owner at a dog park with your dog. You must move and pick up your pooch's poos before other dog owners or their dogs step on them. You have three "messes" before you lose. Every poo = 1 point. The goal is to score as many points as possible and become a hero to humans and hairy pals alike at the Dog Park! 

The player can use arrow keys or A, D, W, and S to control left, right, up, and down movements in order to pick up the poos. 


### Post-MVP Plans

- Add a scenario where it's not poop but throwing treats to just your dog with the danger of it being stolen by other pooches
- Add multi-player options
- Add an option/challenge level for the game player to be required to empty poos in a receptacle before going back to picking up more.
